.SH NAME
SAP HANA System Replication scale-out basic cluster configuration.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
The SAP HANA System Replication scale-out scenario needs a certain basic
cluster configuration.

\fB* CRM Basics\fR

\fBno-quorum-policy = freeze\fR

The crm basic parameter no-quorum-policy defines how the cluster should act in
case of quorum loss. With more than two nodes, the cluster must not ignore the
quorum loss. For SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut, an odd number of nodes is required. Setting
no-quorum-policy to freeze wont shoot anyone when it doesn't have quorum.
Cluster will not be able to add and start new resources.

\fBdefault-resource-stickiness = 1000\fR

The crm basic parameter default-resource-stickiness defines how many score any
resource gets for just stick on the node where it actually runs. This prevents
the cluster from moving resoruces around whithout an urgent need during a
transition.

\fBconcurrent-fencing = true\fR

The crm basic parameter concurrent-fencing allows the cluster to fence more
than one node at a time. This helps to reduce time needed got take over in
case a whole data center got lost. If nodes are fenced one by one, the needed
time would be (number of nodes * stonith timeout). With concurrent-fencing the
time needed is always stonith timeout, independent from the number of nodes. 
See also pcmk_action_limit.

\fBmigration-threshold = 50\fR

The crm basic parameter migration-threshold defines how many error on a
resource could occure before this reosurce will me migrated to another node.

\fBrecord-pending = false\fR

.PP
\fB* SBD STONITH Basics\fR

\fBpcmk_action_limit = -1\fR

The sbd stonith parameter pcmk_action_limit defines the maximum number of
concurrent fencing actions. It allows parallel fencing of multiple nodes. 
-1 means virtually unlimited. See also concurrent-fencing.

\fBpcmk_delay_max = 30s\fR

The sbd stonith parameter pcmk_delay_max defines an upper limit for waiting
before a fencing/stonith request will be triggerd.
This parameter should prevent the cluster from unwanted double fencing in case
of spilt-brain. It is required in two-node clusters. It might not be needed in
usual SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut setups.

.SH EXAMPLES

* crm basic configuration

Below is an example crm basic configuration for SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut. Shown are
specific parameters which are needed. Some general parameters are left out.
The example has been taken from SLE-HA 11 SP4. It should work on SLE-HA 12 SP1
and later as well.

* crm sbd stonith configuration

To complete the sbd setup, it is necessary to activate SBD as STONITH/fencing
mechanism in the CIB. The SBD normally is used for SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut instead
of other fencing/stonith mechanisms.
